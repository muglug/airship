# Uploading / Using Files

## My Uploaded Files

If you are logged into the Bridge, you should see a "My Uploaded Files" link in
the left menu. Click on that. Next, select a Cabin. Most files for your blog
posts will go in Hull, but we left room for this to grow in case you install
additional cabins.

Here, you can upload files to reference in your blog posts. (For example,
images or source code.) You can also create directories to help organize your
uploaded files.

Your files are shared publicly, but only administrators can upload files to
your directory.

## Author Files

From the Bridge, click Authors. Next to each author is a button with an **open
folder icon**. Click that. Each author has its own space for uploaded files.
Anyone with access to the Author can upload/remove files and directories.
