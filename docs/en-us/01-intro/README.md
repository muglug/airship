# Introduction

CMS Airship is a content management system, blog engine, and application
development framework built with three core priorities:

1. Security
2. Usability
3. Flexibility

The purpose of this chapter is to help you get your own Airship off the ground.
This entails installing and configuring CMS Airship on the webserver of your
choice.

For information on how to use your Airship, see [Basic Usage](../02-basic-usage).

If you'd like an in-depth guide to the features we provide, refer to the
[End Users' Guide](../03-end-users-guide).

Finally, if you'd like to jump in and develop your own CMS Airship extensions,
the [Developer Documentation](../04-developer-docs) should get you started. You
may also find value in the [End Users' Guide](../03-end-users-guide) if you are
developing an extension of Airship's core functionality.
