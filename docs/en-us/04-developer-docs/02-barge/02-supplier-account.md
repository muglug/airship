# Create an Airship Supplier Account

Before you can develop extensions, you need to have an account in the Skyport.
This is where public keys and extensions are stored to be shared with the rest
of the CMS Airship ecosystem.

> **[Visit the Skyport](https://airship.paragonie.com)**

At the top of the page, click **Register for Free** to create your account.

The only information we require is:

1. A username
2. An email address
3. A passphrase

After you create your account, you can login with `barge` and begin releasing
your own extensions.

(Note: The Skyport is very minimalistic right now. We plan to improve it.)

## Why "Supplier"?

We've opted for the word "supplier" in favor of "vendor". The word vendor has
connotations of for-profit development, while supplier is neutral. Many open
source software developers sell their creations, but at least as many do not.
